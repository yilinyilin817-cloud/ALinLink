/**
 * Companion SSH connection for Mosh sessions.
 *
 * A Mosh session runs over UDP via a local `mosh-client` PTY and therefore
 * has no ssh2 `Client` (`session.conn`) — the very thing `getServerStats`
 * needs to run its periodic `/proc`-based stats command on an exec channel.
 * Without it the terminal's host-info bar (CPU / memory / disk / network)
 * stays empty for Mosh, while SSH sessions show it (issue #1198).
 *
 * This module lazily opens a *second*, stats-only ssh2 connection to the
 * same host using the same credentials the Mosh handshake already used, and
 * stores it as `session.conn` so the existing `getServerStats` code path
 * works unchanged. It is intentionally best-effort and non-interactive:
 *
 *   - It never prompts the user for a password or key passphrase. The Mosh
 *     handshake (driven by the system `ssh` in the user's PTY) is where the
 *     real, interactive auth happens; this companion only reuses credentials
 *     ALinLink already holds (stored password, parseable private key,
 *     unencrypted / stored-passphrase identity files, ssh-agent).
 *   - If it cannot authenticate or connect, it fails silently and records
 *     the failure so it does not hammer the host on every stats poll. Mosh
 *     keeps working; only the stats bar stays empty (graceful degradation).
 *
 * Security — host-key handling:
 *   - The companion connects ONLY to a host whose live key is already
 *     "trusted" in ALinLink's known-hosts store. A host verifier classifies
 *     the key during the transport handshake and REJECTS the connection for an
 *     unknown / changed key — for every auth method, not just password. This is
 *     done silently and never prompts: the user vets and trusts a host key
 *     through the real interactive session (#1191), and this background stats
 *     poll only ever rides on a host that vetting already approved. An
 *     untrusted host just leaves the stats bar empty (graceful degradation).
 *   - Rejecting outright (rather than merely withholding the password) is
 *     deliberate. Even though public-key / ssh-agent auth discloses no reusable
 *     secret and its signature is session-bound, a *background, user-invisible*
 *     connection that authenticated against an unverified host would still run
 *     the stats command there — letting a MITM / DNS-spoofed host feed bogus
 *     host-info to the user and enumerate the agent's public keys. That breaks
 *     the same host-key guarantee the interactive session enforces, so the
 *     companion refuses unvetted hosts regardless of auth method.
 *   - A gated authHandler additionally withholds the plaintext password until
 *     the verifier has confirmed trust, as defense in depth.
