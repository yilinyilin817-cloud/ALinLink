# Bundled `mosh-client`

This directory holds the network-protocol-only `mosh-client` binary
bundled with the ALinLink installer. ALinLink drives the `ssh` +
`mosh-server` bootstrap itself and then launches this bundled client
directly (see `electron/bridges/moshHandshake.cjs` and
`electron/bridges/terminalBridge.cjs`).

## How binaries land here

1. `.github/workflows/build-mosh-binaries.yml` builds or fetches
   `mosh-client` on relevant pushes/PRs, or on a manual
   `workflow_dispatch`. It uses `scripts/build-mosh/build-linux.sh` and
   `scripts/build-mosh/build-macos.sh` for Linux/macOS, and
   `scripts/build-mosh/fetch-windows.sh` for the pinned Windows binary:

   | target            | provenance                                                      |
   |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `linux-x64`       | upstream source, manylinux2014, static third-party deps + glibc |
   | `linux-arm64`     | upstream source, manylinux2014, static third-party deps + glibc |
   | `darwin-universal`| upstream source, lipo arm64 + x86_64, macOS system dylibs only  |
   | `win32-x64`       | FluentTerminal-pinned standalone fallback, SHA256 pinned        |
   | `win32-arm64`     | (not built — Cygwin arm64 port not yet stable)                  |

   The upstream Cygwin Windows build path was removed from the default
   workflow because the tested build clears the terminal but never
   renders remote output on Windows.

2. When manually dispatched with `release_tag`, that workflow publishes
   the binaries to the dedicated `binaricat/ALinLink-mosh-bin`
   repository. The release gets a tag like `mosh-bin-1.4.0-1`, with
   `SHA256SUMS` attached.

3. Release packaging runs `scripts/resolve-mosh-bin-release.cjs` before
   `npm run fetch:mosh`. It uses an explicit workflow input first, then
   the `MOSH_BIN_RELEASE` repository variable, then the latest
   non-draft `mosh-bin-*` GitHub Release from the dedicated binary
   repository. The fetch step pulls the binaries into
   `resources/mosh/<platform-arch>/`. For local packaging, set
   `MOSH_BIN_RELEASE` yourself before running the same fetch command.
   Override `MOSH_BIN_OWNER` / `MOSH_BIN_REPO` only when testing a
   different binary repository. `electron-builder.config.cjs` then
   copies the matching binary into `Resources/mosh/mosh-client[.exe]`.

   Local dev uses the same binary path: `npm run dev` runs
   `npm run fetch:mosh:dev` first, which downloads the host platform's
   bundled `mosh-client` into this gitignored directory. ALinLink does
   not fall back to a system-installed `mosh` or `mosh-client`; if the
   bundled binary is missing, Mosh startup fails loudly instead of using
   whatever happens to be installed on the developer machine.

   Official Windows package builds currently ship x64 only for bundled
   Mosh coverage. Windows arm64 packaging should be added only after we
   have a tested standalone arm64 client.

The directory is otherwise empty (binaries are gitignored).

## Licenses

- Mosh itself is licensed under **GPL-3.0**
  (https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh).
- ALinLink is **GPL-3.0**, so redistribution as part of the installer
  is permitted.
- The default Windows x64 binary is the FluentTerminal-pinned
  standalone `mosh-client.exe` from
  https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal @ commit `bad0f85`, pinned
  by SHA256 in `scripts/fetch-mosh-binaries.cjs`. The old Cygwin build
  path is intentionally not used for Windows releases while it
  reproduces the blank-screen runtime issue.
- Bundled/static deps (OpenSSL Apache-2.0, protobuf BSD-3-Clause,
  ncurses MIT) are compatible with GPL-3.0.

## Reproducible build

To reproduce the binaries locally:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace \
  -e MOSH_REF=mosh-1.4.0 -e ARCH=x64 -e OUT_DIR=/workspace/out \
  quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64 \
  bash scripts/build-mosh/build-linux.sh
```

For macOS the build needs an Xcode toolchain; see
`scripts/build-mosh/build-macos.sh`.

## Phase 2/3 — done in this PR

- `electron/bridges/moshHandshake.cjs` reimplements the upstream Mosh
  Perl wrapper in Node: parser + sniffer + command builders as pure
  functions.
- `terminalBridge.startMoshSession` runs the SSH bootstrap in a
  node-pty so password / 2FA / known-hosts prompts render naturally
  in the user's terminal, then swaps `session.proc` from the ssh PTY
  to a freshly-spawned `mosh-client` PTY when `MOSH CONNECT` is
  detected. Keystrokes that arrive after the swap go to mosh-client
  because `writeToSession` reads `session.proc` lazily.
- Mosh startup requires ALinLink's bundled `mosh-client` and a usable
  `ssh` client for the remote bootstrap. System-installed `mosh` /
  `mosh-client` binaries are intentionally ignored.
- Windows x64 currently ships the FluentTerminal-pinned standalone
  client because the upstream Cygwin bundle can blank after terminal
  initialization on Windows.

## Roadmap

- Add Windows arm64 only after a tested standalone arm64 client is
  available.
- Make `MOSH_REF` track upstream release tags automatically.
